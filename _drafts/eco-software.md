{% include JB/setup %}

- computers get faster, programmers get lazier
- coding gets easier, programmers get dumber

Comparison: 
- When a car has more safety function, would you drive with more risk, or would you need less knowledge to drive?
- When a car only needs 1l on 100km/h of fuel, would you just push the throttle to the max or would you still try to save fuel?

Bad Examples: 
- Swift (!!)
- XML, JSON
- SOAP
- Interpreted language on the rise

Hope:
- msgpack
- HTTP/2.0
- REST
